# rFTX

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of rFTX is to provide R interface for FTX REST API. The user is required to have an FTX account as the accountâ€™s API key and secret key is used in authentication. These can be created here: https://ftx.com/profile. If you are using a subaccount, some functions allow the name as an argument. This can be left out if not using subaccounts.

## Installation

rFTX package is not yet on CRAN but it will soon be.

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("andreskull/rFTX", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```
## GET Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to fetch trades data for a particular market:

```{r example, message=FALSE}
library(rFTX)

## basic example code
ftx_trades(key = "", secret = "", market = "FTM-PERP")

```

This is another example which shows you how to fetch future funding rates data for two markets:

```{r example2, message=FALSE}
## second example code
ftx_future_funding_rates(key = "", secret = "", markets = c('CRV-PERP','XRP-PERP'))

```
